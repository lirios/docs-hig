Hawaii: At a Glance
===================

The Hawaii workspace is born to take advantage of what Qt, QtQuick,
Wayland and systemd have to offer.

Specific technical and architectural choices were made to ensure that
Hawaii dependencies are trimmed down to a minimum that allows the desktop
to be lightweight without giving up on aesthetics and elegance.

The separation between the compositor and the shell has been removed
in order to provide a snappy user experience and a deep integration between
the desktop components.

We want to make a sleek, fast, elegant and minimalist desktop designed with
casual users and content creators in mind - where what you **do** with the
desktop is more relevant than the desktop environment that should enable
the user and never ever hinder her.
